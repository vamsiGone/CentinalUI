### Brand & Theme

* **Palette:** Electric Blue `#1E90FF`, Deep Blue `#0B235A`, Near-Black `#0B0F14`, White `#FFFFFF`, Soft Gray `#E6EAF2`.
* **Style:** Clean, techy, glass-morphism cards (translucent white/blue with blur), soft shadows, rounded corners (20–24px).

* **Typography:** Headings tall and bold; body highly legible.

* **Inputs:** Large, rounded input fields and text areas; focus ring Electric Blue.
